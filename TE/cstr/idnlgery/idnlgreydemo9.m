%% Modeling A Non-Adiabatic Continuous Stirred Tank Reactor
% A rather common chemical system encountered in the process industry is
% the Continuously Stirred Tank Reactor (CSTR). Here we will study a
% jacketed diabatic (i.e., non-adiabatic) tank reactor described
% extensively in Bequette's book "Process Dynamics: Modeling, Analysis and
% Simulation", published by Prentice-Hall, 1998. The vessel is assumed to
% be perfectly mixed, and a single first-order exothermic and irreversible
% reaction, A --> B, takes place. A schematic diagram of the vessel and
% the surrounding cooling jacket is shown in a plot window. Notice that
% this is a sketch; in reality the coolant flow is, e.g., normally
% surrounding the whole reactor jacket, and not just the bottom of it.

%%
% A model of the CSTR is required for more advanced control approaches.
% The inlet stream of reagent A is fed at a constant rate F. After
% stirring, the end product streams out of the vessel at the same rate as
% reagent A is fed into the tank (the volume V in the reactor tank is thus
% kept constant). The control strategy requires that the jacket temperature
% u_3(t) is manipulated in order to keep the concentration of reagent A
% y_1(t) at the desired level, in spite of disturbances arising from the
% inlet feed stream concentration and temperature (inputs u_1(t) and
% u_2(t), respectively). As the temperature in the tank y_2(t) can vary
% significantly during operation of the reactor, it is also desirable to
% ensure that this process variable is kept within reasonable limits.

%% Modeling the CSTR
% The CSTR system is modeled using basic accounting and energy conservation
% principles. The change of the concentration of reagent A in the vessel
% per time unit d C_A(t)/dt (= d y_1(t)/dt) can be modeled as:
%
%    d C_A(t)
%    -------- = F/V*(C_Af(t)-C_A(t)) - r(t)
%       dt
%
% where the first term expresses concentration changes due to differences
% between the concentration of reagent A in the inlet stream and in the
% vessel, and the second term expresses concentration changes (reaction
% rate) that occurs due to the chemical reaction in the vessel. The
% reaction rate per unit volume is described by Arrhenius rate law:
%
%    r(t) = k_0*exp(-E/(R*T(t)))*C_A(t)
%
% which states that the rate of a chemical reaction increases exponentially
% with the absolute temperature. k_0 is here an unknown nonthermal
% constant, E is the activation energy, R Boltzmann's ideal gas constant and
% T(t) (= y_2(t)) the temperature in the reactor.

%%
% Similarly, using the energy balance principle (assuming constant volume
% in the reactor), the temperature change per time unit d T(t)/dt in the
% reactor can be modeled as:
%
%    d T(t)  
%    ------ = F/V(T_f(t)-T(t)) - (H/c_p*rho)*r(t) - (U*A)/(c_p*rho*V)*(T(t)-T_j(t))
%      dt
%
% where the first and third terms describe changes due to that the feed
% stream temperature T_f(t) and the jacket coolant temperature T_j(t)
% differ from the reactor temperature, respectively. The second term is the
% influence on the reactor temperature caused by the chemical reaction in
% the vessel. In this equation, H is a heat of reaction parameter, c_p a
% heat capacity term, rho a density term, U an overall heat transfer
% coefficient and A the area for the heat exchange (coolant/vessel area).

%%
% Put together, the CSTR has three input signals:
%
%    u_1(t) = C_Af(t)  Concentration of A in inlet feed stream [kgmol/m^3].
%    u_2(t) = T_f(t)   Inlet feed stream temperature [K].
%    u_3(t) = T_j(t)   Jacket coolant temperature [K].
%
% and two output signals:
%
%    y_1(t) = C_A(t)   Concentration of A in reactor tank [kgmol/m^3].
%    y_2(t) = T(t)     Reactor temperature [K].
%
% which also are the natural model states, i.e., y_1(t) = x_1(t) and
% y_2(t) = x_2(t).

%%
% After lumping together some of the original parameters we end up with
% eight different model parameters:
%
%    F               Volumetric flow rate (volume/time) [m^3/h].   Fixed.
%    V               Volume in reactor [m^3].                      Fixed.
%    k_0             Pre-exponential nonthermal factor [1/h].      Free.
%    E               Activation energy [kcal/kgmol].               Free.
%    R               Boltzmann's gas constant [kcal/(kgmol*K)].    Fixed.
%    H               Heat of reaction [kcal/kgmol].                Fixed.
%    HD = c_p*rho    Heat capacity times density [kcal/(m^3*K)].   Free.
%    HA = U*A        Overall heat transfer coefficient times tank
%                    area [kcal/(K*h)]                             Free.
%
% Four of the parameters are here specified to be free (i.e., to be
% estimated). In practice, one could probably also determine the
% pre-exponential nonthermal factor k_0 and the activation energy E from
% bench scale experiments. This would then simplify the identification task
% to only consider two unknowns: the heat capacity c_p and the overall heat
% transfer coefficient U (which are inferred from HD and HA, respectively,
% as rho and A are known).

%%
% With the above introduced notation, the following state-space
% representation is obtained for the CSTR.
%
%    d x_1(t)
%    -------- =  F/V*(u_1(t)-x_1(t)) - k_0*exp(-E/(R*x_2(t)))*x_1(t)
%       dt      
%
%    d x_2(t)
%    -------- =   F/V(u_2(t)-x_2(t)) - (H/HD)*k_0*exp(-E/(R*x_2(t)))*x_1(t)
%       dt      - (HA/(HD*V))*(x_2(t)-u_3(t))
%
%      y_1(t) = x_1(t)
%      y_2(t) = x_2(t)

%% Input-Output Data
% System identification experiment design for many nonlinear systems is
% typically much more involved than for linear systems. This is also true
% for the CSTR, where on one hand it is desired that the controllable input
% u_3 is such that it excites the system sufficiently and on the other hand
% it must be chosen to be "plant-friendly" (the chemical process must be
% kept stable, the duration of the test should be as short as possible so
% as to influence the production least, and so forth). The article:
%
%   M.W. Braun, R. Ortiz-Mojica and D.E. Rivera, "Application of minimum
%   crest factor multisinusoidal signals for "plant-friendly" identification
%   of nonlinear process systems", in "Control Engineering Practice", no. 10,
%   2002. 
%
% discusses the choice of input signals to the CSTR. There it is argued
% that a multi-sinusoidal input u_3 is advantageous to a multi-level pseudo
% random input signal for several reasons. In the identification
% experiments below we will use two such input signals, one for estimation
% and one for validation purposes, that were generated through a MATLAB(R)
% input data generation tool (a GUI) kindly provided by the authors of the
% mentioned article.

%%
% We load this CSTR data and place it in two different IDDATA objects, ze
% for estimation and zv for validation purposes:
load(fullfile(matlabroot, 'toolbox', 'ident', 'iddemos', 'data', 'cstrdata'));

%%
% *Figure 3:* Estimation data set outputs from a CSTR.

%%
% Before we proceed with the identification experiments, we should mention
% that the generated input signals force the outputs of the CSTR to display
% a lot of the reactor nonlinearities (with temperature changes of around
% 80 degrees overall and causing some of the "ignition" phenomena of the
% reactor to be evident). Whereas this excites the reactor (typically good
% from an identification point of view), it is probably not the way in
% which engineers would like to operate a real-world reactor, especially
% not one that is as exothermic as this one. Using the guidelines described
% in Braun et al. (2002), one could then redesign the experiment before it
% is actually carried out. In this case, it would be interesting to try to
% reduce the duration of the experiment and use multi-sinusoidal input
% signals with shorter cycle lengths. The aim is to reduce the
% low-frequency content of the controllable input signal so as to reduce
% the variations in the reactor outputs.

%% Performance of the Initial CSTR Model
% How good is the initial CSTR model? Let us investigate this by simulating
% the initial model using the input signals of ze and zv and compare the
% computed outputs with the true outputs (obtained by simulating the above
% IDNLGREY model using other parameters and adding some noise) contained
% in ze and zv, respectively. Notice that calling COMPARE with two input
% arguments leads to that the whole initial state vector of the model for
% each experiment is estimated.
clf
compare(ze, nlgr);
figure; compare(zv, nlgr);

%%
% *Figure 4:* Comparison between the true outputs and the simulated outputs
% of the initial CSTR model.

%% Parameter Estimation
% The agreement between true and simulated outputs of the initial CSTR
% model is decent. To further improve it, we estimate the four free model
% parameters as well as the initial state vector of the model by using the
% estimation data set ze. We instruct NLGREYEST to display iteration
% information and to perform at most 25 search iterations.
opt = nlgreyestOptions('Display', 'on');
opt.SearchOption.MaxIter = 25;
nlgr = nlgreyest(ze, nlgr, opt);

%%
% If desired, the search can always be continued via a second call to
% NLGREYEST (or PEM). This time NLGREYEST is instructed to not display any
% iteration information and to only carry out at most 5 more iterations.
opt.Display = 'off';
opt.SearchOption.MaxIter = 5;
nlgr = nlgreyest(ze, nlgr, opt); %Estimate nonlinear grey-box model parameters

%% Performance of the Estimated CSTR Model
% To evaluate the performance of the estimated model we once again use
% COMPARE:
compare(ze, nlgr);
figure; compare(zv, nlgr);
%%
% *Figure 5:* Comparison between the true outputs and the simulated outputs
% of the estimated CSTR model.

%%
% Visual inspection immediately reveals that the outputs of the estimated
% model are close to the true outputs, both for ze and zv. The improvement
% is especially significant for the validation data set, where the model
% fits have increased from negative values to around 70% and 99%,
% respectively, for the two model outputs.

% Further information about the estimated CSTR model is next returned by
% PRESENT:
present(nlgr);

if exist('simulink','builtin')~=5
    disp('The remainder of this tutorial requires Simulink.');
    return;
end

%% Simulation of the Estimated CSTR Model in Simulink
% An IDNLGREY model can also be imported and used within Simulink. The
% Simulink model "cstr_sim" imports the validation data set zv and passes
% its data to a Simulink IDNLGREY model block, which when simulated
% produces outputs that together with the used input signals are stored in
% the MATLAB workspace in the IDDATA object zsim. (The last five lines of
% code below are used to ensure that the proper model inputs are fed to 
% the Simulink model. This is only needed if idnlgreydemo9 is run within a
% function, where access to zv and nlgr cannot be guaranteed.)
open('cstr_sim');
if ~evalin('base', 'exist(''zv'', ''var'')')
    cstrws = get_param(bdroot, 'modelworkspace');
    cstrws.assignin('zv', zv);
    cstrws.assignin('nlgr', nlgr);
end

%%
% *Figure 6:* Simulink model containing the estimated CSTR model.

%%
% The generic IDNLGREY Simulink library block is found in the standard
% system identification Simulink library and can be copied to and used in
% any Simulink model. For example, in the CSTR case it could very well be
% used in a closed-loop control arrangement.
%
% The IDNLGREY block must be configured before it is simulated. This is
% done by entering the MATLAB workspace variable holding the IDNLGREY model
% (here nlgr) or by defining a proper IDNLGREY model object using the
% idnlgrey constructor in the parameter edit box labeled "IDNLGREY model".
% Here it is also possible to specify the initial state vector to use
% (default is the internally stored initial state vector of the specified
% IDNLGREY object).

%%
% An IDNLGREY model object stores the properties specifying the setup of
% the differential/difference equation solver used by SIM, PREDICT,
% NLGREYEST and so on (see nlgr.SimulationOptions for options controlling
% the simulation of the model). In Simulink, these settings are always
% overridden so that the options of the Simulink specified solver are used.
% If the IDNLGREY model object specifies and uses a different solver, then
% the simulation result obtained in Simulink might be different to that
% obtained with IDNLGREY/SIM in MATLAB. An example illustrating this is
% provided in the example "idnlgreydemo10".
%
% With the solver options settled, we can next perform a command prompt
% simulation of the cstr_sim Simulink model (which here will be conducted
% for the estimated CSTR model). (The evalin call is needed to retrieve
% zsim in case idnlgreydemo9 is run within a function.)
